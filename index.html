    <h1>Conceptual Exercise - CSS Fundamentals</h1>
    <li>
        Question 1 - Explain how CSS differs from HTML in the 
        context of web development.
    </li>
        <ul>
            HTML is a hypertext language that is used to create the structure of a webpage, while CSS 
            is a style sheet language that is used to style the structure 
            created by HTML. HTML creates the structure of a 
            webpage by using tags to define the different elements of the 
            page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc.
        </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        Question 2 - List the methods of including CSS in an HTML 
        document and briefly describe each.
    </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline css - Inline css is used to apply a style to a single element. It is done by using the style attribute in the opening tag of the element.</li>
            <li>Internal css - Internal css is used to apply a style to a single webpage. It is done by using the style element in the head section of the webpage.</li>
            <li>External css - External css is used to apply a style to multiple webpages. It is done by creating a separate css file and linking it to the html file using the link element in the head section of the webpage.</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        Question 3 - Describe the anatomy of a CSS rule.
    </li>
        <ul>
            The css rule consist of a selector, declaration, property, and value. The selector
            is the element that the rule applies to in which what we would like to style, the declaration 
            is the property and value that is being applied to the selector which is everything in curly braces.
            Property is the property that is being applied to the selector located left of the colon and the 
            Value is the value of the property located right of the colon followed by a semicolon.
        </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        Question 4 - When might you want to use RGBA instead of RGB?
    </li>
        <ul>
            You would want to use RGBA instead of RGB when you want to add an alpha channel to the color
            which allows you to control the opacity of the color. For example when you want to create a 
            hover effect on a button and you want the button to change color slightly when hover over it.
        </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        Question 5 - How do Hex color values differ from RGB?
    </li>
        <ul>
            Hex color values are written in a hexadecimal format while RGB color values are written in a
            decimal format.
        </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        Question 6 - When might a developer prefer to use HSL over
        other color formats?
    </li>
        <ul>
            A developer might prefer to use HSL over other color formats when they want to easily adjust
            the hue, saturation, and lightness of a color.
        </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        Question 7 - What are the primary text properties used in CSS 
        to modify the appearance and layout of text?
    </li>
        <ul>
            The primary properties used in css are font-family, font-size, font-weight, font-style, 
            text-align, text-decoration, text-transform, line-height, letter-spacing, text-shadow, and color.
        </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        Question 8 - In what scenarios might it be beneficial to use <b>vh</b> 
        or <b>vw</b> as a unit for font size?
    </li>
        <ul>
            Its beneficial to use vh or vw as a unit when you want the font size 
            to be a certain percentage of the viewport width or height. This comes  in handy 
            when you want the font size to be responsive to the size of the screen or window.
        </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        Question 9 - Explain the difference between <b>em</b> and <b>rem</b> units.
    </li>
        <ul>
            In css em is a relative unit of measurement that is based on the font-size of the parent element 
            while rem is based on the font-size of the root element.
        </ul>
    <br>
    <li>
        Question 10 - If multiple font families are listed in the font-family
        property, how does the browser decide which one to display?
    </li> 
        <ul>
            When you list font families in the font-family property, the browser will use the first font 
            family that was listed, if the browser does not support the font it will move on to the second
            font listed, and so on until it finds a font that it supports.
        </ul>
